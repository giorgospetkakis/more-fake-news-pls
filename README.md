## Abstract  
This article examines the effects of several features, including non-linguistic, lexical, syntactic, semantic and emotional, in detecting fake news. The dataset we used was the one provided by PAN @ CLEF 2020- 300 authors of 100 tweets each. Using a Gradient Boosting classifier we achieved up to 73% validation accuracy, with the most important features being self-Word2Vec word embeddings and emotion features. We also implemented train-time and validation-time data augmentation, which improved our results by generalizing the word embeddings and improving the reliability of validation accuracy.
