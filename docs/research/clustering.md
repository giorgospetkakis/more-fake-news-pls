# Clustering

## Overview

Clustering is the dominant technique in unsupervised machine learning and can be very useful to us for an initial analysis of our data.
We already know how to implement and use k-means (and it may be enough!) but there are [many other clustering algorithms out there](https://machinelearningmastery.com/clustering-algorithms-with-python/).

## Current Implementations

It is very easy to find modern implementations of these algorithms, even within some of the most popular machine learning packages in python, and there are otherwise tutorials (see above) for implementing them. 

The difficulty level on this is quite low, and the information we could get is likely to be useful.

## How Can We Use It?

At a minimum we can use clustering to preview data relationships and to figure out groupings after a PCA or a different feature pruning / dimensionality reduction step. 

This does not mean that it is will constitute the final prediction, but it can inform us of the nature of the features we have, so we can tune it further.
