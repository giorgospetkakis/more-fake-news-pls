# Author Profiling

## Overview

Author profiling is a technique used to extract as much information about a person or agent only from text. 

## Typical Information Extraction

Typical information gained from author profiling:

- Age
- Gender
- Personality traits (more recent)
- Bot / Human ?

## Current Implementations

Unfortunately, there are no preset libraries that perform author profiling at the present moment. Most of the research on this is very recent, and uses state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms, often in combination.

## How Can We Use It?

There are two ways I can see us using this approach:
- Fork someone else's implementation (under creative commons license)
- Implement our own and use external data

They both come with downsides, and the data we get may be very useful, but this may not be worth our time.
